# Rankingnetwork
Pythonscripts for my Bachelorproject

Ranking.py contains the actual simulation and model. /n
NodeProbs.py is a small module to build and plot the link-participation-probabilities
The other files are mainly created to analyse different things. e.g. Richclubs.py plots the Rich-Club-Coefficients for the network snapshots
